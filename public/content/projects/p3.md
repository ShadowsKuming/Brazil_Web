### Why did humans evolve the eyes we have today?

While scientists can't go back in time to study the environmental pressures that shaped the evolution of diverse vision systems, a new computational framework allows researchers to explore this evolution in artificial agents.

The framework evolves visual sensors and learning policies over many generations, enabling controlled comparisons across different “evolutionary trees”.

- Motivation: understand pressure → perception trade-offs  
- Method: embodied agents + simulated environments  
- Output: interpretable emergence of visual strategies
